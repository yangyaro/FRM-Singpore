Description: 
'This paper is about a systemic risk measure, Financial Risk Meter (FRM), 
which is calculated based on penalization parameters of linear quantile lasso regressions of large financial institutions. 
The standard daily FRM is the averaged daily penalization parameters among all financial institutions. 
This paper applies FRM to the Singapore market, and generalizes the standard FRM index to FRM candidates using quantiles of penalization parameters.
Furthermore, the FRM framework is able to identify individual risk characteristics and to capture spillover effects
in a network. .'
 
Keywords: 'systemic risk measure, FRM, linear quantile regression, gacv, penalisation parameter, correlation coefficient,network analysis'
